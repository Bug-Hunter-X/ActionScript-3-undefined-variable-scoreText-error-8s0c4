This repository contains a demonstration of a common ActionScript 3 error: attempting to use an undefined variable within a function. The `bug.as` file demonstrates the error, while `bugSolution.as` provides the correction.  The error occurs because the `scoreText` variable, referencing a text field used to display the score, is not properly declared before use. The solution initializes the variable and assigns it to an existing display object.  This is a crucial concept for ActionScript 3, especially when integrating dynamic text displays within the application.
